# Game of Life in Ruby

## Running the game
To run the game type `run states/<file name>`, where file name is one of the 
following:
- glider.txt
- pulsar.txt
- acorn.txt
- beacon.txt
- diehard.txt

*Note: as of now, if a configuration never causes the grid to be empty, Ctrl-C is 
the only way to stop the game loop.*
